# BTCTracker
Show live and historical BTC | ETH | LTC data on tvOS

## Data origins
I'm using the [CryptoCompare API](https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/#-api-data-pricehistorical-) to get the historical price data about the different currencies.

## Graphs
To display the data on screen the awesome [Charts](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Charts) Pod is used.

## Usable?
I only made this because I was bored one day and felt the need to view bitcoin history on the TV, but it's neither well built, nor very feature rich, so I would definitely not recommend using this.	
Instead maybe just contribute to the project? ðŸ˜‰
